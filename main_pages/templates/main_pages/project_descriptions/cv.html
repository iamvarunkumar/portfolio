            <p>
                The CV: Real-Time Multi-Object Tracking & Behavior Analysis project focused on developing a computer vision system to analyze video streams in real-time. This involved:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    **Multi-Object Tracking:** The core of the system was a real-time multi-object tracking capability. This was achieved by integrating the YOLOv8 object detection model with the DeepSORT tracking algorithm. YOLOv8 accurately identifies objects in each frame of the video, while DeepSORT maintains the identity of each object across frames, even when they temporarily disappear or overlap. This integration resulted in a significant improvement in tracking accuracy compared to standard tracking methods.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Behavior Analysis:** Beyond simply tracking objects, the system also analyzed their behavior. This was done using trajectory clustering techniques to identify patterns in the movement of objects. By analyzing these patterns, the system could detect anomalous events, such as unusual traffic flow or suspicious movements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Performance Optimization:** To ensure the system could operate in real-time, significant effort was invested in optimizing its performance. TensorRT was used to accelerate the inference process, achieving a substantial reduction in latency and enabling the system to process video at 30+ frames per second on the target hardware.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Deployment and Scalability:** The entire system was containerized using Docker, allowing for easy deployment and portability. It was then deployed on the AWS cloud platform, leveraging services like EC2 (for compute) and SageMaker (for machine learning). The deployment was designed to be scalable, enabling the system to handle multiple concurrent video streams efficiently. CI/CD pipelines were implemented to automate the deployment process, reducing deployment time and ensuring consistent updates.
