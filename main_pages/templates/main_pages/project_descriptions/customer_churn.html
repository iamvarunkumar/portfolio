            <p>
                The Customer Churn Prediction project focused on developing a model to predict customer churn and implement strategies to improve customer retention. This involved:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    **Churn Reduction:** The primary goal was to build a model that could accurately predict which customers were at high risk of churning, allowing for proactive interventions to prevent them from leaving. The successful implementation of this model resulted in a 15% reduction in churn rate, directly contributing to increased revenue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Survival Analysis:** To effectively model customer lifecycles and understand the factors that influence churn, survival analysis techniques were employed. Specifically, Cox proportional hazards regression was used, along with Box-Cox transformations to ensure the data met the model's assumptions. This approach provided insights into the time-to-churn and the relative importance of different predictors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **LLM for Personalized Explanations:** To enhance customer relationship management, an LLM (LangChain) was integrated into the system. This allowed for the generation of personalized explanations for high-risk customers. These explanations provided insights into the reasons for their potential churn, enabling targeted communication and interventions to address their specific concerns and improve their likelihood of staying.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Deployment:** The churn prediction model and the LLM-driven insights were deployed via a Flask web application. This application provided a user-friendly interface for customer relationship managers to access and utilize the predictions and explanations in their daily work, facilitating proactive customer retention efforts.
